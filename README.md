# Video Project Portfolio
This repository serves as an index to my video portfolio, submitted as supplementary material for my college applications.  
The projects reflect my primary interest in computer science, with design and visual thinking used as tools to explore social impact, systems, and sustained curiosity.

## Projects

### 1. Expense Tracker Application - Computer Science

**Source Code:** https://github.com/shang3301/expense-tracker

**Focus Areas:** Python, SQL, Data Structures, Data Visualization

**Overview**  
I built a desktop expense manager using Python, SQL, and Tkinter that allows users to create accounts, manage tables, record transactions, and generate graphical analyses of spending patterns.

**Motivation**  
I was interested in how abstract concepts such as data organization and querying translate into tools that help users make sense of their own behavior.

**Key Ideas Explored**
- Relational database design  
- User-driven data creation and querying  
- Transforming structured data into visual insight  

**Reflection**  
This project emphasized the importance of persistence in debugging interconnected systems, and showed me how thoughtful data structure design directly affects clarity, scalability, and user trust.

### 2. School Competition Website (IMAGE) - Computer Science & Web Development

**Source Code:** https://github.com/shang3301/image

**Website Link:** https://csnimage.vercel.app/ 

**Focus Areas:** React, TypeScript, Frontend Architecture, Animation

**Overview**  
I developed a responsive website for a school competition using React and TypeScript, incorporating GSAP animations to guide user attention while maintaining performance and accessibility.

**Motivation**  
I wanted to explore how structured code and intentional motion design can communicate information more effectively than static pages.

**Key Ideas Explored**
- Component-based design  
- Responsive layouts across devices  
- Purposeful use of animation as feedback  

**Reflection**  
This project helped me understand how design decisions emerge from constraints, and how clean architecture enables both visual clarity and long-term maintainability.

### 3. Tree Donation App - UI/UX for Social Impact

**Showcase:** https://www.behance.net/gallery/240566993/Echo

**Focus Areas:** UI/UX Design, Human-Centered Design

**Overview**  
I designed a tree donation application focused on minimizing friction, building trust, and clearly communicating impact to users.

**Motivation**  
I was interested in how digital interfaces can encourage participation in social good by reducing cognitive and emotional barriers.

**Key Ideas Explored**
- User flow optimization  
- Designing for transparency and trust  
- Aligning interface decisions with ethical goals  

**Reflection**  
This project reinforced my belief that technology’s impact depends less on novelty and more on how thoughtfully it aligns with human values.

### 4. Art Auction App - UI/UX Design  

**Focus Areas:** UI/UX Design, Human-Centered Design, Digital Marketplaces

**Overview**  
I designed an art auction platform that balances clarity with urgency, allowing users to engage with artwork while navigating competitive decision-making.

**Motivation**  
I wanted to explore how interface structure influences perception of value and time-sensitive choice.

**Key Ideas Explored**
- Information hierarchy under time constraints  
- Visual cues and behavioral influence  
- Designing systems that shape decision-making  

**Reflection**  
This project deepened my understanding of how subtle design choices can guide user behavior, often more powerfully than explicit instruction.

## Common Themes
Across these projects, I consistently focused on:
- Building end-to-end  systems 
- Learning through trial and error  
- Applying technical skills toward social and human-centered goals
