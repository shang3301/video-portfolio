# Video Project Portfolio
This repository is a context to my video portfolio, submitted as supplementary material for my college applications (Fall 2025, Regular Decision).  
The projects reflect my interest in computer science, with design and visual thinking used as tools to explore social impact, systems, and curiosity.
